The Village of Consort is governed by an elected Mayor and Council who work together to make decisions that shape our community's future. Our local government is committed to transparent, accountable, and responsive service to all residents.

## Your Local Government

The Village Council consists of the Mayor and Councillors who are elected every four years to represent the interests of Consort residents. Council meetings are open to the public, and we encourage residents to attend, ask questions, and participate in the democratic process.

## What Council Does

Village Council is responsible for:

- Setting the strategic direction for the community
- Approving the annual budget and tax rates
- Establishing bylaws and policies
- Making decisions on land use and development
- Overseeing municipal services and operations
- Representing the community at regional and provincial levels

## How to Get Involved

There are many ways to engage with your local government:

- **Attend Council Meetings**: Regular meetings are held monthly and are open to the public
- **Delegation Requests**: You can request to speak to Council on specific issues
- **Public Hearings**: Participate when Council considers bylaws, development permits, or other matters requiring public input
- **Contact Your Councillors**: Reach out to your elected officials with questions or concerns
- **Review Meeting Materials**: Agendas and minutes are available online

## Transparency & Accountability

We believe in open and transparent government. All Council meetings are public (except for specific confidential matters as permitted by legislation), and meeting agendas, minutes, bylaws, and policies are available for public review.

## Strategic Planning

The Village of Consort develops strategic plans to guide long-term decision-making and ensure we're working toward shared community goals. These plans are developed with input from residents and stakeholders.
