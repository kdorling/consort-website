The Recreation Services department brings energy and connection to our community through programs, events, and well-maintained facilities. We manage the Consort SportEx—home to the community hall, ice arena, curling rink, and bowling alley—as well as the Sports Grounds, which feature five ball diamonds, a bunnock facility, and a seasonal concession. Recreation Services is also responsible for both of the Village's campgrounds: the Consort Municipal Campground and the Open Sky Getaway. Whether you're looking to stay active, host an event, or enjoy the outdoors, we're here to help make it happen.
