## Monetary Policy

The Bank of Canada's main responsibility is to conduct monetary policy to preserve the value of money by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. This contributes to sustained economic growth and rising living standards for Canadians.

### Our Inflation Target

Since 1991, the target for monetary policy has been to keep inflation at 2 per cent—the midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent target range. The inflation target is set jointly by the Bank and the federal government and reviewed every five years.

### Policy Interest Rate

The Bank influences the economy and inflation mainly by raising or lowering its policy interest rate—the target for the overnight rate. Changes in the target influence other interest rates, such as those for consumer loans and mortgages. They also affect the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar.

### Key Tools

- **Policy Interest Rate**: The primary tool for conducting monetary policy
- **Forward Guidance**: Communication about the likely path of the policy rate
- **Quantitative Easing**: Large-scale purchases of Government of Canada bonds when needed
- **Balance Sheet Policies**: Managing the size and composition of the Bank's balance sheet
